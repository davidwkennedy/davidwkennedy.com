            What I mean by "nerd" is that I enjoy math, science, and other technical persuits; nerd makes no statement whatsoever about any proclivity for Star Trek or any other pop culture.

            <strong>When</strong> my wonderful girlfriend is out of town for the weekend, I don't hit up the town with my boys. Lazy weekends are spent working through end-of-chapter problems
            in my math books, such as Concrete Math by Graham, Kuth, and Patushnik. My nerdy interests are many, but I go through phases during which some topics garner more of my time.
            Staples are numbery theory, set theory, graphy theory, data-compression, and cryptography. Some of my current "phase" interests include ternary logic, cartography, typography,
            and software project management.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Professionally</strong> I'm a software developer. My expertise is web development on the .NET stack, which includes ASP.NET, C#, Sql Server, Internet Information Services (IIS).
            Nearly all of my web development relies heavily JavaScript, CSS, HTML, XML, and other supporting technologies. I've professionally developed or maintained applications written in Java, C++,
            MYSql, Node.js, and a few other technologies. I've dabbled in Python, Php, MatLab, x86 assembly, and others. I have never once written a single line of Perl. If possible, I try to
            avoid VB Script, VBA, or Classic ASP.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>I started</strong> programming by teaching myself using my TI-86 calculator manual; my motivation was to write programs to do my math homework
            <em>for</em> me. My first program multipled any number by 5. I then explored QBasic and JavaScript. I attended Utah State University to study Computer Engineering,
            which is a specialized form of Electrical Engineering (emphasising Computer Science) and is in the College of Engineering. After 2 years I switched to Computer Science with an emphasis
            on Electrical Engineering; Computer Science was in the College of Science. Since my departure from USU, the CS deparment has been moved from the College of Science to the College of
            Engineering - a move with which I disagree.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>It is</strong> my firm belief that professional software development is much more than "memorizing the codes", as many people seem to believe. Software development 
            is the process by which business needs are codified.
